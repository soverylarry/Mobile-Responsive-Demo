# Week-2-Homework
Unit 02 CSS - Bootstrap Homework - Responsive Portfolio

This Homework is intended to demonstrate my understanding and deployment of Bootstrap CSS Framework. I created a mobile responsive portofolio, home/about page and contact page. Additionally a Navbar (called a LarBar now!) was added along with a sticky footer. This was a challenging but rewarding assignment.
